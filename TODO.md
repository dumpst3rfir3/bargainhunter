# Essentials

✔  Pull price of body text (for Newegg pages)
    ✔  Test: no price in body text should return error
- Store the price
- Read all stored prices
- Amazon (Chromedriver?)
  - Detect CAPTCHA (etc)
- Simple start: just store/check price every time the user runs it

# Neat

- "Do stats" on store prices
- Multiple stored products?
- Make decision whether it's a daemon, web page, something that runs continuously, etc.
- Multiple websites?

# Super neat
- Configurable (user could add config for how to recognise prices on unknown sites)
