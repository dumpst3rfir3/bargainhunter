# PoC: Bargain Hunter
This was done as a proof-of-concept as part of training to learn test-driven development in Go. The tool is supposed to keep track of the price of a product (via a URL passed to it) and notify the user whenever there is a bargain (e.g., a price drop). It was never completed, but concepts were learned.
